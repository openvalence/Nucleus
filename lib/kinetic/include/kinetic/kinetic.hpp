// Kinetic — jerk-limited dual-mode motion core (quintic waveform + Ruckig).
//
// PURPOSE
// -------
// The jerk-limited motion core: every incoming
// motion command becomes ONE planned trajectory computed from the engine's
// ACTUAL current kinematic state (position + velocity + acceleration), and the
// existing ~1 kHz stream sampler simply evaluates it. Event-driven, never
// clocked — a plan is computed only when a command arrives (or when a stream
// starves mid-glide, see SETTLE below).
//
// THE DIVISION OF LABOR (measured, not assumed -- see the part-1 bench)
// --------------------------------------------------------------------
// Ruckig Community is a superb POINT-TO-POINT planner and a poor waveform
// INTERPOLATOR: its minimum_duration-stretched profiles are bang-cruise-bang
// (no smoothness objective -- following interior points is the Pro "waypoints"
// feature). Measured on the v4 sparse-sine bench: RMS deviation 0.090 for the
// stretched Ruckig profile vs 0.005 for a quintic Hermite, at 28 vs 8 peak
// accel. Handing Ruckig perfect boundary conditions (af = source) does not
// change the shape. Hence:
//
//   * WAVEFORM (any point carrying a duration): a HERMITE segment in the
//     client's declared family from the current (p,v,a) to (target,
//     G-velocity, af-estimate) over exactly the commanded duration. Every one
//     is CEILING-SCANNED at plan time; a segment that demands more than
//     vmax/amax/jmax (or leaves the window) is handled by InfeasiblePolicy.
//     Since 0.7.0 a waveform segment may also arrive with ONE-SEGMENT
//     LOOKAHEAD (Command::next_chord), which arms the RFC-008 handoff sanity
//     guard: the sender's end velocity is bounded to the Fritsch-Carlson knot
//     limit of the segment that FOLLOWS, so an infeasible handoff is caught
//     BEFORE it forces the shape/amplitude/deadline sacrifices. See
//     boundHandoffVelocity.
//   * CHASE (bare high-rate points, no duration): the future is unknown ->
//     Ruckig chases the point stream under the ceilings, replanning per point
//     from the sampled state (C2-continuous, retarget-while-moving is the
//     normal case). For DENSE streams (mean interval <= 60 ms) the engine aims
//     one interval AHEAD of the newest point with the estimated stream velocity
//     as the arrival velocity -- chasing the newest stale point by construction
//     lags ~4 intervals (measured). Sparse/isolated points get pure
//     point-chase (no invented velocity).
//   * SETTLE: a trajectory that ends still-moving with no fresh command gets
//     a one-time jerk-limited brake-to-rest via Ruckig's velocity interface.
//     A boundary event, not a clock loop. Guarded by a GRACE WINDOW
//     (Config::settle_grace_us): a stream whose next command is merely a few ms
//     late is not a starved stream, and braking on ms-scale transport jitter is
//     worse than holding (see maybeSettle).
//
// THE TWO AXES AN INFEASIBLE SEGMENT MAY SPEND
// --------------------------------------------
// AMPLITUDE and SHAPE, and nothing else. Duration is spent only by Stretch,
// which is the other contract entirely (see InfeasiblePolicy).
//
// SHAPE is the span's END HANDLE. A span's curve is set by its boundary
// tangent magnitudes; lerping the end handle toward the span's own CHORD SLOPE,
// by a fraction alpha, walks the curve continuously from the sender's spline
// (alpha = 0) toward the flattest shape this span can take:
//     handle >> chord  -> overshoot bulge, peak |v| at the ENDS (measured 36x
//                         the span's mean velocity on a shallow Makima span)
//     handle == chord  -> straight line, peak |v| = 1.0x mean, peak |a| = 0
//     handle == 0      -> smoothstep S-curve, peak |v| = 1.5x mean, mid-span
// so demand falls from EITHER side of the chord, which is what makes it a
// feasibility knob rather than a one-directional fudge.
//
// alpha = 1 IS NOT A LITERAL STRAIGHT LINE. Only the END handle is ours to
// move -- the START is the machine's ACTUAL (v, a), and planning from it is
// doctrine, not a preference. So alpha = 1 means "the straightest curve
// reachable FROM THE STATE THE MACHINE IS ACTUALLY IN". Sufficient anyway: the
// reduction PROPAGATES, because segment N's adopted vf IS segment N+1's actual
// starting v. Do not describe this as reaching linear interpolation.
//
// WHAT THE SHAPE AXIS CAN AND CANNOT BUY. A min-jerk quintic peaks at
// 15/8 = 1.875x its mean velocity; a straight line at 1.0x. So the entire
// shape budget is worth a 1.875x velocity headroom factor and not one unit
// more, because MEAN velocity is |target-p|/T with both terms pinned by the
// sender. Once mean velocity alone exceeds the ceiling, no handle length on
// earth helps and AMPLITUDE must go -- which is why the both-axes-spent case is
// ROUTINE rather than exotic: it is simply "conservative limits + aggressive
// script", the most common infeasible state in the field.
//
// TERMINAL CASE (both budgets spent, still illegal): the Ruckig guard takes the
// segment -- the whole stroke, late, DeadlineStretched. That is the honest
// "your machine cannot do this" answer.
//
// SAFETY / BOUNDS
// ---------------
// Ruckig Community has NO position limits and quintics can bulge, so the
// Engine owns the window:
//   * command targets are clamped to [0,1] at commit;
//   * requested end velocities are clamped so the machine can brake before
//     the wall beyond the target (|vf|² ≤ amax·dist_to_wall, and ≤ vmax);
//   * quintic plans are legality-scanned (v/a/j ceilings AND window bounds)
//     before adoption — illegal shapes fall back to the Ruckig guard;
//   * sampled OUTPUT position is clamped to [0,1]; the arbiter's window clamp
//     remains the hard physical backstop downstream.
// Limits are CEILINGS, never targets (the doctrine, verbatim).
//
// UNITS & TIME
// ------------
//   position : normalized 0..1 across the configured stroke window
//   velocity : normalized units per second (TCode G wire value / 1000)
//   time     : microseconds, uint64, injected by the caller (esp_timer on
//              target, synthetic in native tests — fully deterministic)
// Public API is float; planning math is double (plan-time only — the 1 kHz
// sample path is a polynomial/profile evaluation).
//
// THREADING
// ---------
// Single-threaded by contract: ALL of
// commit/positionAt/velocityAt/snapshot run on Core 1 (the sampler task).
// Cross-core command handoff stays OUTSIDE this class. No locks, no heap in
// steady state (Ruckig's waypoint vectors stay empty in community mode).
//
// Hardware-free: std headers + vendored lib/ruckig only. Native-tested in
// test/native/test_kinetic. The scenario-trace bench did not come across from
// the archived SlopDrive-32 repo; regenerate it there if a waveform needs
// eyes on it.

//             axes an infeasible segment actually has, AMPLITUDE and SHAPE,
//             together in the ratio `infeasible_blend` sets and only as far as
//             legality demands, so a segment 10 % over gives up about 10 % of

//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A funscript rendered through Pchip or Makima is a C1 CUBIC
// HERMITE spline: those two interpolators differ ONLY in the rule they use to
// pick knot tangents, and given endpoint positions plus endpoint tangents the
// cubic on a span is uniquely determined. So {target, duration, end_vel} on
// channel 0x0085 is not a lossy summary of the sender's curve — for any C1
// cubic-Hermite family it is a COMPLETE ENCODING of it. Nothing is missing from
// the wire; what differs is what we rebuild it WITH.
//
// A C2 quintic CANNOT reproduce a C1 cubic across a knot, by construction: the
// script's acceleration genuinely STEPS there, and a C2 curve is required to
// make curvature continuous. Rounding that step off is not smoothing noise, it
// is deleting script content — and the `af` the quintic needs is not even on the
// wire, so it is estimated as a backward difference of consecutive handoff
// velocities, i.e. an estimate of a quantity that is genuinely TWO-VALUED at the
// knot it is estimated at. The operator identified this on hardware as motion
// that tracked the script's positions but not its character.
//
//   FollowClient — the sender declares its curve family and we honor it. NO
//                  WIRE SIGNALING EXISTS YET (that is the pending RFC), so with
//                  nothing declared this resolves to C2 — i.e. today's behavior,
//                  byte for byte. This value is the safe default and stays that
//                  way; when the RFC lands, only the resolution changes.
//   ForceC1      — always cubic. Reproduces a Pchip/Makima span exactly.
//   ForceC2      — always quintic. The pre-0.8.0 engine.
//
// SCOPE — READ BEFORE MOVING THE CALL SITES. C1 applies to WAVEFORM SEGMENT
// commits only, never to chase points, settle, or the Ruckig guard. A cubic
// takes four boundary conditions (p, v) → (target, vf) and therefore DROPS the
// machine's current acceleration `a`, so a plan begins with an acceleration STEP
// relative to what the carriage is actually doing. At a script knot that step is
// exactly right — the script has one there too. Anywhere else (a preemption
// mid-span, a chase replan, a settle) it would be a spurious torque step with no
// authoring behind it, which is why those paths keep the quintic.
//
// THE STEP IS DELIBERATELY UNBOUNDED. Nothing clamps it, because clamping it is
// precisely "manufacture curvature continuity the script did not ask for" — the
// thing C1 mode exists to stop doing. The jerk ceiling remains a MACHINE SAFETY
// limit and is not repurposed as a shape control. Consequence worth knowing

// ---- RFC-008 handoff sanity guard -------------------------------------------
// "The machine plans for the worst so clients don't have to."
//
// THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR (measured live, MFP plugin v0.2.1-0.2.3 against
// Valence Sim, 2026-07-25): a funscript axis on Makima interpolation produced a
// handoff velocity of 1.816 norm/s into a span whose own mean velocity is
// 0.050 norm/s — 36x over. The client was computing a MATHEMATICALLY CORRECT
// spline tangent; there is simply no monotone quintic that covers 0.050 of
// span-mean displacement while ARRIVING at 1.816. The legality scan rejected
// the quintic, the Ruckig guard took the segment, and a "slow, simple" script
// rendered as straight-line strokes with a flat-topped velocity trace. Worse,
// the af backward-difference estimator then carried the oversized value into
// the NEXT segment's boundary conditions.
//
// THE CRITICAL DETAIL: bounding end_vel against the CURRENT segment's own
// chord is NOT sufficient. 1.816 was entirely sane relative to its own span
// (whose chord was ~3.0 norm/s) and absurd only relative to the NEXT one.
// A guard that cannot see forward cannot catch this class at all.
//
// THE BOUND: the handoff lives at the KNOT shared by two segments, so it must
// be feasible for BOTH —
//
//     |end_vel|  <=  k * min(|chord_in|, |chord_out|)
//
// which is the Fritsch-Carlson knot limiter (the same bound the MFP plugin
// currently carries client-side, applied where RFC-008 says it belongs). Sign
// is preserved: a wrong-signed handoff stays wrong-signed but bounded, so the
// ONLY thing this changes is pathological SIZE. A zero chord on either side (a
// plateau, or "the target IS where the next segment ends") forces 0 — arriving
// at a hold still moving is exactly the kind of lie the Ground Truth doctrine
// exists to prevent.
//
// WHY min AND NOT chord_out ALONE: min() is strictly stronger, it satisfies
// "never exceeds the following chord's limit" by construction, and it stays
// monotone in |chord_out| (min(a, ·) is non-decreasing). It also costs nothing
// to compute — chord_in is |target - p| / T, which the engine already knows
// exactly, from the machine's ACTUAL position rather than a sender's guess.
//
// IN-BOUNDS INPUT IS RETURNED BIT-FOR-BIT UNCHANGED. That is a hard contract,
// not an implementation detail: a guard that perturbs a well-behaved client's
// handoff is a feel regression for every well-behaved client, which is a worse
// bug than the one it was written to fix.
//
// `chord_in` / `chord_out` are non-negative magnitudes in units/s. A NEGATIVE
// value means "unknown" and disables the bound (never bound on a guess); so
// does k <= 0, which is the guard's off switch. Non-finite anything is passed
// through — Engine::commit() rejects non-finite command inputs upstream, and a
// numeric guard is not the place to relitigate that.
